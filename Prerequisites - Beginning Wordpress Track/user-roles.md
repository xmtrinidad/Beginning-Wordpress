# WordPress User Roles

Users Roles in WordPress determine level of access for editing and creating content on the WP site.

## Default Roles

* Administrator
* Editor
* Author
* Contributor
* Subscriber

User Roles can be accessed from the admin menu and clicking on the *Users* tab.  Here, the user profile can be viewed along with all users and there's an option to add a New User.

## Super Admins and Administrators

A **Super Admin** is the account first set-up when installing WordPress.  Other **Administrators** can be set up, but the biggest difference between them is that the Super Admin has access to the site network administration features.

Only admin level accounts can create new users.

## Managing User Roles

* Intelligent usernames and smart passwords
* Remove users who are no longer active
* Only give access for what is really needed
