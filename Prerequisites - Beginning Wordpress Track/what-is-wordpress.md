## How a CMS works

The advantage of a CMS is that it makes building websites easier by hiding all the work required
to build the website behind the scenes.

A simple website requires HTML and CSS and is uploaded live through a number of technologies.  To make edits, the HTML/CSS files are edited directly, saved and then reuploaded.  For static projects, this isn't a big issue, but for larger websites with dynamic content it is much more difficult to handle.

Using a blog, for example, there may be a main "Blog Listing" page, an "Individual Blog" page and on the "Home Page" there may be a headline with the latest blog post.  Rather than updating these individual pages each time a new blog is made, a database could be used to store the blog post data.  Then a programming language like PHP (which which WordPress is built with) to add code to get code from the database and update specific pages.

At this point, updating a website would require editing the database or the back-end code.  A CMS gives the user an interface between the data in a database and the user.  Most CMSs have well designed admin areas that allows the user to see all the data from the database organized in a nice modern clean way.

CMSs have *themes* which is the code that controls how the front-end of the website looks like.
