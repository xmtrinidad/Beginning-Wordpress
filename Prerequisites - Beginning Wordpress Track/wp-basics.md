# WordPress Basics

This readme will cover the basics of WordPress (using the Twenty Fifteen theme)

## Logging into a WordPress Site

With pretty much any WP site, adding "/wp-admin" will bring up the log in page.

## Default Content in WordPress

Two primary types:  Pages and Posts

### Pages

Pages are "static" content, one page with its own URL.  Pages can be updated and edited but don't change too much once they are created.

Pages can have a parent > child structure; one parent page can have several child pages

### Posts

Dynamic content; published regularly and appear at different places on the site.

## Categories and Tags

**Categories**      
Group together similar content on a website; all blog posts must be assigned at least one category

**Tags**        
Identify more specific topics within a post.  Posts can have many tags.  Tags are optional.
