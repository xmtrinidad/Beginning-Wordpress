# Beginning-Wordpress
Starting to learn WordPress Development from Team Tree House ([track link](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/wordpress-development))

## About This GitHub Repository

This GitHub repo will serve as a place to take notes and attach any projects that I start as I go through the WorePress track
on Team Tree House.

I have basic knowledge of CMSs (some Drupal experience), but I've never looked into WordPress.  I think understanding the basics
is an important skill to have on top of my other Front-End Development skills.  My goal is to get enough knowledge to start my own
WordPress projects so I can display I have the ability to learn WordPress or any other technologies I would need on the job.
